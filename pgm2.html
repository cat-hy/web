<h3>What Is A Post Graduate Degree?</h3>
<p style="color:white;font-size:20px;font-family:Georgia,serif">
Any degree beyond a bachelor's is typically referred to as a postgraduate (or simply graduate) degree. Learn more about types of postgraduate degrees and whether earning one could impact your career.<br>
The term “postgraduate degree” covers everything from postgraduate diplomas to master's degrees to doctoral degrees. Essentially, any degree that requires an undergraduate (bachelor's) degree as an admissions prerequisite can be considered a postgraduate degree. You might choose to pursue a postgraduate degree for a variety of reasons, including to change career paths, specialize in a highly-technical field, or move into a career in research or education.
